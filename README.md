# BKZone - The paradise for laptops
Welcome to our BKZone project.

## âœ‹Introduction 

Nowadays, E-commerce should be no strange term for younger generation, especially shopaholics. In this assignment, we will take a deep look into how a intermediately-ranked e-commerce website works and attempt to implement a clone website with the knowledge acquired from Web Programming Course (CO3049) at HCMUT.

### Technology Stack
* Front-end: ReactJS, Bootstrap 5, SCSS preprocessor, and many complementary libaries provided by npm.
* Back-end: Vanilla PHP.
* Database: MySQL with MySQLi ODM.
* Security: Session, JWT,..
* Architecture Pattern: Model-View-Controller (MVC).

## ðŸŽ¯Features Built
### Guests Level
1. Item Retrieval: Guests can search and filter items to their needs.
2. News and Policy: Furthermore, they can view the latest news and Statement of Policy for the company.

### User Level
1. Store and Purchase: User can add items to the waiting list and purchase the items with three different methods: CoD (cash on delivery), Banking and QR Code. User Session will be kept, so that the waiting list would not be refreshing after each login session.
2. Comment and Rating: User can give comments for each item. The overall score for the item will then be recalculated to match the update.
3. Payment History and Personal Information: User can track the status of orders and change personal information.

### Admin Level
1. Authorization: When the guest signed in as Admin, he would be able to redirect to Admin Dashboard. Otherwise, no further admin actions are allowed.

For server folder, turn on XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache (port 8080) + MySQL modules.

You have installed all of dependencies now, so let's get started!

## ðŸ›  Running BKPass


```bash
  cd client
  npm start
```


The ReactJS application will run on http://localhost:3000 and the PHP backend application will run on http://localhost:8080


Done! Let's discover our BKPass xD. Good luck and have fun <3
